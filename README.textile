<p>First attempt of scraping specific performance data for GP practices via nhs.uk. 

I've only scraped a small number of GP practices to save hammering the nhs.uk server.</p>

<p>Data refers to:
<uk>
<li>GP survey data- Opening hours</li>
<li>GP survey data- Consultation with Doctors</li>
<li>% Score for Organisation of Practice</li>
</uk>
</p>
<p>
I might just scrape the lot if there's a good reason too. 
</p>
<p>I've collected the nhs.uk ID number for each practice via <a href"https://scraperwiki.com/scrapers/nhs_choices_gp_recommended/">an earlier scraper</a> as well as here.</p>
